# ViewBinding-DataBinding-Practice

View binding is a feature that makes it easier to write code that interacts with views. Once view binding is enabled in a module, it generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. An instance of a binding class contains direct references to all views that have an ID in the corresponding layout.


View binding is null safe and type-safe, and supports both Java and Kotlin
